# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- It is the version three of the Todo App in which I practiced new concepts of react 1) React-Icon Library, 2) Inspecting with React Dev Tools, 3) Forms in React, 4) useRef Hook, 5) Spread operator, 6) Functional updates, Context API.
